# investment_tracker_app

Abstract of This Project :-



In response to the challenges faced by investors in managing their portfolios in real-time, we have created the "Investment Tracker App." This application not only alleviates the stress and time-consuming nature of manual investment management but also provides comprehensive analysis and strategic advice on optimal investment choices. Covering diverse investment types such as real estate, stock markets, and mutual funds, the app, developed using Flutter for cross-platform accessibility and backed by a secure backend powered by Node.js and MySQL, ensures seamless tracking and analysis. Its real-time capabilities empower users with instant insights into their portfolio's performance, enabling well-informed decision-making and ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of their investment strategy.
